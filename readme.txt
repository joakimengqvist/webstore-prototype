This is an project I made in a recruitment process. The idea of the project is to show knowdledge of using frameworks and building a prototype of a real application.

To start the project locally all you need to do is clone the repo and then:

run
npm install

run 
node server.js

and then open localhost:5000 in your browser.

Important note:
The application is not compatible with all screen widths due to time management when creating this project.


Best regards
Joakim Engqvist
