A little info of my assignment.

I choose to go for Express.js as it is a framework that I have worked with before, and felt good to be able to show some framwork knowledge.
I've used the inbuilt session variable to save data in the current session so the choices the user makes are saved and do not vanish while browsing the site.

Design I have made it simple to view using bootstrap. I find it timesaving to use bootstrap as i begin projects, and then alter the design as the project excels. It gives a very clear picture of how the application works.

I took it as if the item was {"available": false} it was not possible to order this item even if there were in stock of some colors, and therefor I made the product unavailable to put in the car. 
The available products are able to put in the cart as long as the color is in stock.

I did not alter the information in the json file, so at the moment the actual jsonfile with the data does not get updated due to input from user. Data is only fetched from the json file acting as database.
This means that the quantity is shown, but application is not taking the amount in consideration while adding adding to cart, but I am confident that the solution I present clearly shows my ability to create such a solution.

Worth mentioning is that I did not fully mobile device the application 100% due to time allocated to the actual programming solution rather then screen compatability of the application to all screen resolutions.

One last mention is that the application code is filled with console.log commands as of testing, while testing the separate functions in the application the output and location of the function.
Also there is a lot of comments in the code explaining each segment of code. In an application in production mode I would remove the console.log commands.

Thanks for taking the time to review my assignement and for having me this far in the process of recruitment :)

Best regards
